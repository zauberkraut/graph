# graph
A Go graph algorithms library. At the moment, it only uses the Erdős–Gallai
characterization to detect graphic sequences in linear time. If you only wish to
detect whether a sequence is graphic without generating a graph from it, this
method is preferable to the quadratic-time Havel-Hakimi algorithm.
